\chapter{Kolyvagin systems and biduals}

The results on the previous chapter were limited in two different directions: the coefficient ring $R$ was required to be principal and the core rank was at most one. These two assumptions were relaxed in the work of D.~Burns, R.~Sakamoto and T.~Sano. In this work, Kolyvagin systems are redefined as collections of classes in the bidual exterior powers of Selmer groups and can be used to bound the Fitting ideals of the Selmer group. However, Kolyvagin systems in this setting do not determine all Fitting ideals of the Selmer group, and one need to introduce the notion of Stark system in order to do that.

\section{Preliminaries on exterior powers}

\section{Stark Systems}

Let $m,n\in \NN$ be square-free products of Kolyvagin ultraprimes such that $m\mid n$. There is an exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^m}(\Q,T)\ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,T)\ar[r] & \prod_{\ell\mid \frac{n}{m}} \bH^1_{s}(\Q,T)}\]
By proposition \ref{prop:bidual_map}, this exact sequence induces a map
\[\Phi_{n,m}:\ \bigcap^{r+\nu(n)} \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,T)\to \bigcap^{r+\nu(m)} \bH^1_{\FF^m}(\Q,T)\]

\begin{lemma}
Let $\m,n,r\in \NN$ be square-free products of Kolyvagin ultraprimes such that $m\mid n\mid r$. Then
\[\phi_{r,m}=\phi_{r,n}\circ \phi_{n,m}\]
\label{lem:com} 
\end{lemma}

\begin{definition}
The set of Stark systems of $\FF$ is defined as the inverse limit
\[\bSS(\FF):=\varprojlim_{n\in \NN} \bigcap^{r+\nu(n)} \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,T)\]
\end{definition}


\begin{theorem}
Let $n\in \NN$ be a core vertex. Then the projection map
\[\bSS(\FF)\to \bigcap^{r+\nu(n)} \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,T)\]
is an isomorphism.
\label{th:stark_core_projection}
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
We only need to prove that if $n\in \NN$ is a core vertex and $\ell\in \PP$ does not divide $n$, the map
\[\bigcap^{r+\nu(n\ell)} \bH^1_{\FF^{n\ell}} (\Q,\bT)\to \bigcap^{r+\nu(n)} \bH^1_{\FF^n} (\Q,\bT)\]
is an isomorphism. This map is induced by the exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,\bT)\ar[r]&\bH^1_{\FF^{n\ell}}(\Q,\bT)\ar[r] & \bH^1_s(\Q_\ell, \bT) \ar[r] &0}\]
Since $\Ext^1(\Lambda,\Lambda)=0$, the dual map $\bH^1_{\FF^{n\ell}}(\Q,\bT)^+\to \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,\bT)^+$ is surjective. Hence we can construct an injective map 
\[\bigwedge^{r+\nu(n)} \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,\bT)^+ \to \bigwedge^{r+\nu(n\ell)} \bH^1_{\FF^{n\ell}}(\Q,\bT)^+\]
which turns out to be an isomorphism since both are free $\Lambda$-modules of rank $1$. Therefore, its dual map is also an isomorphism.

\textcolor{blue}{perhaps comment that $n\ell$ is also a core vertex}
\end{proof}

\subsection{Core vertex}

\begin{definition}
A \emph{core vertex} of rank $r$ is a square-free product of ultraprimes $n\in \NN$ such that $\bH^1_{\FF^*_n}(\Q,\bT^*)=0$ and $\bH^1_{\FF}(\Q,\bT)$ is a free $\Lambda$-module of rank $r+\nu(n)$.
\end{definition}

\begin{proposition}
Let $n\in \NN$ be a core vertex and let $m\in \NN$ be such that $n\mid m$. Then $m$ is also a core vertex.
\label{prop:core_vertex_div}
\end{proposition}

\begin{proof}
Since $n\mid m$, then $\bH^1_{\FF_m}(\Q,T)$ is contained in $\bH^1_{\FF_n}(\Q,T)$, so it also vanishes. The exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,\bT) \ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^m}(\Q,\bT) \ar[r] & \bigoplus_{\ku\mid \frac{m}{n}}\bH^1_s(\Q_{\ku},\bT)\ar[r] & 0}\]
The first and third terms of this exact sequence are free modules of ranks $r+\nu(n)$ and $\nu(m)-\nu(n)$. Hence $\bH^1_{\FF^m}(\Q,\bT)$ is free of rank $r+\nu(n)$.
\end{proof}

\begin{assumption}
    There exist an integer $r$ and $n\in \NN$ such that $\bH^1_{\FF^*}(\Q,\bT^*)=0$ and $\bH^1_{\FF^n}(\Q,\bT)$ is a free $\Lambda$-module of rank $r+\nu(n)$.
    \label{ass:core_vertex}
\end{assumption}

\begin{corollary}
The module of Stark systems $\bSS(\FF)$ is a free $\Lambda$-module of rank one.
\end{corollary}

\begin{theorem}
Let $\varepsilon=(\varepsilon)_{n\in \NN}$ be a generator of $\bSS(\FF)$. For every $m\in \NN$, the image of $\varepsilon_m\in \Hom\left(\bigwedge^{r+\nu(m)} \bH^1_{\FF^m}(K,\bT)^+,\Lambda\right)$ contains the $0^{\textrm{th}}$ Fitting ideal of $\bH^1_{\FF_m^*}(\Q,\bT^*)$ with finite index.
\end{theorem}

\begin{proof}
By assumption \ref{ass:core_vertex} and proposition \ref{prop:core_vertex_div}, there exists a core vertex $n$ such that $m\mid n$, which leads to the following exact sequence
\[\xymatrix{0\ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^n}(K,\bT) \ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^m}(K,\bT)\ar[r] & \prod_{\ku\mid n/m} \bH^1_\s(K_\ku,\bT) \ar[r] & \bH^1_{\FF^*_m}(K,\bT^*)\ar[r] & 0}\]
which induces a map 
\[\phi_{n,m}:\ \bigcap^{r+\nu(n)} \bH^1_{\FF^n}(K,\bT)\to \bigcap^{r+\nu(m)} \bH^1_{\FF^m}(K,\bT)\]

Since $\varepsilon$ generates $\bSS(\FF)$, Theorem \ref{th:stark_core_projection} implies that $\varepsilon_n$ generates $\bigcap^{r+\nu(n)}$. Since $\varepsilon_m=\phi_{n,m}(\varepsilon_n)$, then proposition \ref{prop:bidual_fitting} implies that the image of $\varepsilon_n$ contains $\Fitt^0(\bH^1_{\FF_m}(\Q,\bT^*))$ with finite index. 
\end{proof}
